2. **Order Management**:
   - `GET /orders`: Fetch all orders (Admin only).

   - `POST /wishlist/add`: Add a product to the wishlist.
   - `DELETE /wishlist/remove/:productId`: Remove a product from the wishlist.
   - `GET /wishlist`: Fetch all wishlist items for the logged-in user.

4. **Authentication**:
   - `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
   - `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a user.
